 * we can add folder to deleted folder
 * we can even del main or root dir by making it inactive
 * Eror handliinh 
 * In db files stored as files:array -> obj
 * if the F_num is accidentally chaged to F-num in uload js , it will thwo nwanted error 
 * if username is not entered also it makes users in DB
 * In email.js the verify user is send err like already reisgterd becuase of the USER_ID invalid or res is undefined
 * in logi API it only shows the err message as email nt verified , but i have to show the status :0
* This error not only happedn in this file, it is apllicable to all, in changePwd.api.js if u not check for undefined req.body and sent it lib func then it err as "data rg..." but this was shwng in resulting api to frontend. solve that
* userid should e=be in number but strnig in webpdfconverter data
* getFIle info having status : 1 even there was no such file error location fetchFile.ks 
* in db driveinfo , after creating new folder at the very first first time the Folder: null, then second is obj , sometimes the obj is fifth time
pdfconverter.js line 67
* if username containing space the usernma is not trimmmed in userverification
* if i uncomment req.body.folder in userpageroute /home then it will throw error as reference error ,so it sends {status:0msg...} but it was a page request i dont sne dlike that 
* when uncaught exception caught for page requet ,it resposnd like api err message

 hack:-
    if the next is in the 
        for(let i of item) {
            switch(conf):
                cas

                cas 2

                defa: 
                    next()
                    break;
            }

        the loop continues , the 1st next sends to errrormidlleare  but also the loop continues, so it cause real erro
