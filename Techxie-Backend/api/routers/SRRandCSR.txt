below is a good idea , but now we cant touch the already working stuff so lets make this below all to CSR
so here after the frontend pages should be build with SSR template engine [handlebars]


CSR -pages
    The static page also come under this category , becaus we gonna put route(/something,fn(req,res){res.render(something.html)})
        login
        signup
        settings
    Mostly they are fetched through api and rendered in frontend
        pdfviewer
        videoplayer
        Webdrive -- the search engine should update so .
SSR - pages
    Home -  from fetched folder data
    Recents - from recent db
    Trash -- from not active

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Basic handlebars syntax
layout is simple html wrapper which contain {{{body}}} like html.....body ..../html --just {{{body}}}
{{{body}}} -for layout
{{}}
#each /each
#with /with
#if /if

you can add else to above all fn ive mentioned
unless - this is inverse to #if

option.fn- compiled template
